  "description": "Awesome Startup is a distributed company with employees working all over the world. This project is a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory. It uses data from the [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random employees. The 12 employees are then listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.",
