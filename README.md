# Employee Directory

Awesome Startup is a distributed company with employees working all over the world. This project is a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory. It uses data from the [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random employees. The 12 employees are then listed ina. grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.
